title: Getting Started
---

This documentation portal should provide you with everything you need to get started with RMRK as a
user or developer.

Please refer to the individual sub-sections of the docs for more information on specific versions,
products, and tools RMRK offers, or read below to get familiar with RMRK in general.

> Note that these docs are geared towards technical users and those who would like to get to know RMRK in depth. An easy-to-consume non-technical knowledgebase is published [here](https://coda.io/@rmrk/faq).

## What is RMRK?

RMRK is a set of NFT standards which compose several "NFT 2.0 lego" primitives. Putting these legos
together allows a user to create NFT systems of arbitrary complexity:

- [Nested NFTs](lego1-nested)
- [Multi-resource NFTs](lego2-multi-resource)
- [Equippable NFTs](lego2.5-equippable)
- [On-chain emotes](lego3-emote)
- [Conditional Rendering](lego4-conditional-rendering)
- [NFTs as DAOs](lego5-dao)
- [Non-transferable NFTs](nontransferable)

The legos exist in three formats:

- [Kusama implementation](rmrk2)
- [EVM implementation](evm)
- [FRAME Pallet implementation](pallets)

One of the best short introductions into RMRK is the following video:

## What is RMRK's history?

RMRK (pronounced "remark") was founded in 2020 by [Bruno Škvorc](https://twitter.com/bitfalls), Web3
Foundation's technical educator at the time. Originally a hobby project, RMRK evolved into a team of
20 people.

Learn more about some of the team on [the homepage](https://rmrk.app).

The RMRK team is the custodian and main developer of the set of open source NFT 2.0 standards known
as _RMRK standards_ and of the [Skybreach metaverse](https://skybreach.app), and a for-profit
company building products on top of this infrastructure.

Put bluntly, the RMRK team wanted to build cool products, but the infrastructure to build them on
did not exist yet so they chose to build the infrastructure first. This infrastructure is now
available to everyone.

## How do I use RMRK?

As a user or author, you can mint on the [Singular UI](https://singular.app). A self-help knowledgebase is set up [here](https://coda.io/@rmrk/faq), and our [YouTube channel](https://url.rmrk.app/yt) has various tutorials on how to use the app.

As a developer who wants to build their own wallet or UI for RMRK, you probably want to [learn the concepts first](lego1-nested), then refer to the [Specs](https://github.com/rmrk-team/rmrk-spec), or if you'd like to use existing components we've
built, the [Tools](https://github.com/rmrk-team/rmrk-tools).

## RMRK-based projects

### Official

- [Singular](https://singular.app): the official NFT marketplace for RMRK NFTs: create and sell
  advanced NFTs
- [Kanaria](https://kanaria.rmrk.app): NFT birds that can wear other standalone NFTs, equip and
  unequip items, and have multiple resources - the first production demo of RMRK 2.0

## The RMRK Token

The RMRK token is the protocol's official token. It is not required to use the protocol, but can
augment the experience. For more information about the $RMRK token, please see
[this page](https://singular.app/tokens).
