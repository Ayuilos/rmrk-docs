title: Getting Started
---

Welcome to the RMRK docs. This documentation portal should provide you with everything you need to
get started with RMRK. Please refer to the individual sub-sections of the docs for more information
on specific versions, products, and tools RMRK offers, or read below to get familiar with RMRK in
general.

## What is RMRK?

RMRK (pronounced "remark") is a set of standards on the [Kusama](https://kusama.network) blockchain
which compose five "NFT lego" primitives. Putting these legos together allows a user to create NFT
systems of arbitrary complexity.

## How do I use RMRK?

You can mint on the [Singular UI](https://singular.rmrk.app).

As a developer who wants to build their own wallet or UI for RMRK, you probably want to refer to the
[Specs](https://github.com/rmrk-team/rmrk-spec), or if you'd like to use existing components we've
built, the [Tools](https://github.com/rmrk-team/rmrk-tools).

## RMRK-based projects

### Official

- [Singular](https://singular.rmrk.app): the official NFT marketplace for RMRK 1.0 NFTs
