---

The RMRK NFT 2.0 Concepts are divided into RMRK legos and RMRK concepts. Legos are primitives that
make up complex use cases and enable certain _concepts_. Each lego will also describe some of its
own concepts as examples on its own page.

## RMRK Legos

- [Nested NFTs](/lego1-nested)
  - The ability for any NFT to contain other RMRK NFT
- [Multi-resource NFTs](/lego2-multi-resource)
  - The ability for an NFT to vary its output depending on the context it is being loaded in
- [Equippable NFTs](/lego25-equippable)
  - The ability for NFTs to equip owned NFTs in order to gain extra utility or change their
    appearance, also known as composable NFTs
- [On-chain emotes](/lego3-emote)
  - The social mechanic of sending and rendering received emotes (emoji reactions) on any NFT
- [Conditional Rendering](/lego4-conditional-rendering)
  - The ability for an NFT to have different client-side outputs depending on some on-chain or
    off-chain values
- [NFTs as DAOs](/lego5-dao)
  - The ability for NFTs to be fractionalized and community governed

## RMRK Concepts

- [Non-transferable NFTs](/nontransferable)
  - The ability for NFTs to be bound to another NFT or to an account address
- [Provable Digital Scarcity](/scarcity)
  - The concept that an NFT is only available in one place at one time, enforced by the blockchain's
    security.
- [Ownership of Experience](/ownershipxp)
  - The ability to evolve an NFT over time and keep the experience of interacting with an environment bound to the NFT's value, contextually and on-chain.
